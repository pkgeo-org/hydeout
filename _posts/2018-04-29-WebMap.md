**Creating Simple Basic Webmap**
1. Download _index.html_ from [PKgeo's GitHub page](https://github.com/pkgeo-org/waurisa2018_workshop_data) and save into new clean directory.
This index.html file contains basic code to display web map using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) with style.json file.

2. Copy the previously exported _style.json_ file from Maputnik vector tile style editor into the same directory location created in step 1 above.
3. Open _style.json_ in a text editor.
    + Edit line 13 and 14. Change the coordinates to 47.613 and -122.3988. This latitude and longitude will display the map center on Seattle

http-server -p 5000
`

4. Open your browser and type in localhost:5000 then refresh the browser to see your map.

+ Click _login_ at the top right and login with your GitHub credentials.
+ Delete the existing code in the _index.html_ tab, and copy in the contents of your _index.html_ file from step 1 above.
+ Press the _+_ button at the top far right  to add a new file then name it _style.json_.
+ Copy in the contents of your _style.json_ file from step 2 above.
