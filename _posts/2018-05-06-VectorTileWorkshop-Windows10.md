In this lesson we will learn to use Docker containers to deploy various tools to create and serve vector tiles on your laptop running Windows Pro or Enterprise Edition.

__If you are running Windows 10 Home please use the [Windows 10 Home instructions](/vector%20tiles/2018/05/01/VectorTileWorkshop-Windows10Home.html)__

## 1. Enable Hyper-V in Windows ##
+ __Requires Windows 10 Pro  or Enterprise__
+ [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) provides hardware virtualization support in Windows
+ Open a PowerShell terminal window as Administrator
+ To enable Hyper-V temporarily, enter the following command at the Power Shell prompt
  
    `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V â€“All`

+ __TIP:__ [Step-by-step guide](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2015/09/08/step-by-step-enabling-hyper-v-for-use-on-windows-10/) to enable Hyper-V permanently on your computer. This includes a discussion of how to enable Virtualization in BIOS.

## 2. Install Docker on Windows 10 ##
+ __Requires Windows 10 Pro  or Enterprise__
+ Download [Docker Community Edition for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows)
+ Double Click the Docker for Windows Installer.exe file
    + Follow the instructions and accept default settings
    + You may be asked to provide your password during installation 
	+ You may be asked to restart your computer to complete the installation. If your computer restarts, you will need to reenable Hyper-V as explained in step 1 above.
+ Start Docker for Windows from the Start Menu
+ Turn on Drive Sharing
    + Open the settings for Docker
    + Select the _Share Drives_ option ![screen shot](/assets/images/windows10pro_docker_share_drives.png "Docker Share Drives Settings") [_image source_](https://forums.docker.com/t/volume-mounts-in-windows-does-not-work/10693/6)
    + Check the box next to "C"
    + Click _OK_ and you will be prompted for credentials with admin privileges
+ If Docker was installed with an admin account different from your user account, you will need to check that your user is in the local docker-users group for your machine

## 3. Install a GDAL/OGR tools container ##
+ Start a PowerShell Terminal with your normal user privileges. In other words do not start as admin as you did before.
+ Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
+ Search for gdal
+ Select [klokantech/gdal](https://hub.docker.com/r/klokantech/gdal/)
+ Copy the Docker Pull Command & run it at PowerShell prompt
  
    `docker pull klokantech/gdal`

## 4. Convert Shape file into GeoJSON file ##
+ Download zipped files of [King County 2000 Census Block Groups](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FfLKbGalJnULsJo1fjzOhwtO4wVYHvoq)
+ Place zip file into your local user directory (eg: C:\Users\keump)
    + "keump" will be replaced with your local user name
+ Unzip zip file
+ Use OGR tools at the PowerShell prompt
    + _ogrinfo_: check the shape file's information

        `docker run -it --rm -v C:\Users\keump:/data klokantech/gdal ogrinfo KingCo_2000_Census_BlockGroups.shp -al -so`
  
    + _ogr2ogr_: convert shape file to GeoJSON file
 
        `docker run -it --rm -v C:\Users\keump:/data klokantech/gdal ogr2ogr -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f GeoJSON KingCo_2000_Census_BlockGroups.geojson KingCo_2000_Census_BlockGroups.shp -Progress`

## 5. Locate a GeoJSON file ##
+ You can download the following GeoJSON file for next step if needed
  + [King County 2000 Census Block Groups GeoJSON](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ofMZSOH34HIMNKqjo0w4H9qzzAukCKQg)
  
## 6. Install a Tippecanoe container which is a utility tool to create vector tiles ##
* Search for Tippecanoe on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
* Select the [jskeates/tippecanoe repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/jskeates/tippecanoe/)
* Copy the appropriate command from the *Docker Pull Command* section of the page
* Paste it at the PowerShell prompt, and hit enter to run it

	`docker pull jskeates/tippecanoe`

## 7. Create some vector tiles ##
+ Ensure Docker is running on your computer
+ Start Tippecanoe container in interactive mode at the PowerShell prompt

	`docker run -it -v c:\users\keump:/home/tippecanoe jskeates/tippecanoe:latest`

+ You will see your command prompt change to look like `bash-4.3$`
+ Use the tippecanoe command at the PowerShell prompt to create vector tiles from the geoJSON file

	`tippecanoe -o KingCo_2000_Census_BlockGroups.mbtiles KingCo_2000_Census_BlockGroups.geojson`
	
+ Exit the container when it is done

	`exit`
	
+ The vector tiles will be $HOME/KingCo_2000_Census_BlockGroups.mbtiles
    + $HOME represents your user directory at a unix style command prompt.

## 8. Install a TileServer GL container ##
+ Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
+ Search for tileserver-gl
+ Select [klokantech/tileserver-gl](https://hub.docker.com/r/klokantech/tileserver-gl/)
+ Copy the Docker pull command & run it at the PowerShell prompt

    `docker pull klokantech/tileserver-gl`

## 9. Run TileServer GL <a name='starttileserver'></a>##
+ Ensure Docker is running on your computer
+ From the command line change into the directory where you have placed your mbtiles file.

+ Start the TileServer GL container from the PowerShell prompt

    `docker run --rm -it -v C:\users\keump:/data -p 8080:80 klokantech/tileserver-gl`
 
+ Windows may prompt you to create a firewall exception, depending on your security settings. If asked, agree to the exception
+ Test that the vector tiles are being served by entering [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080) into your browser's address bar
  
+ After testing, hit __ctl-C__ to quit TileServer GL
