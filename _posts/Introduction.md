Hello there. This page is contains materials for Washington URISA 2018 Workshop. This workshop describes and demonstrates various FOSS4G (Free Open Source Software for Geospatial) tools to create vector tiles, to stylize vector tiles and to build web-maps.

We'll explore FOSS4G workflow to create web-maps from vector tiles. We'll have presentations with demonstrations which will follow with hands-on exercises to style vector tiles and create web-maps. In addition, we'll be also be exploring Mapbox Studio workflow as well.

Who are we? We are two FOSS4G enthuists GIS professionals working for King County, Washington.
