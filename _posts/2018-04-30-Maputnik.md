## What is Maputnik? ##
Maputnik is a vector tile visual style editor that is easy to use, free and open source. It is a style editor with immediate feedback to create Mapbox GL styles using the [Mapbox GL style specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/). Maputnik does not require a cloud based deployment and will run on your local machine.

    * Under _Assets_, click on and download _public.zip_ to your local drive.

2. Move the unzipped contents of _public.zip_  into a directory (i.e $Home/Document/Maputnik/public).
3. Open your terminal window, and be sure you are in the directory with those contents.
